Demonstrates the capability of http requests 


## YouTube View bot
Input your YouTube video link into the `url = ''` brackets and then it will gain a view. You should use proxies if you want to obtain lots of views.

























For legal reasons, don't use this. This has only been made to demonstrate the amazing capabiaties of the requests and threading Python modules. I have published this on GitHub for people to see and improve their sites against it. You should not use this for any bad purposes.
